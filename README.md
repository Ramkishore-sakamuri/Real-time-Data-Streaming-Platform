# Real-time IoT Data Streaming Platform

This project provides a basic framework for a real-time data streaming platform designed for processing and analyzing IoT sensor data. It includes a simple data producer, a consumer for basic analysis, and a Docker Compose configuration for a local Kafka setup.

**Note:** This is a simplified example and does not include full fault-tolerance or exactly-once delivery semantics, which would require more complex configurations and additional technologies (e.g., Kafka Transactions, Flink, Spark Streaming). if anyone is interested in collaborating! Whether you have experience with:

Stream processing frameworks (Kafka Streams, Flink, Spark Streaming)
Messaging systems (Kafka)
Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
IoT data handling
Distributed systems and fault tolerance
Python or Java development
...or if you're just passionate about learning and contributing, I'd love to connect!

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Docker
* Docker Compose

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd realtime-data-platform
    ```

2.  **Start the Kafka environment using Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will start a Zookeeper and a Kafka broker.

3.  **Install required Python libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install confluent-kafka
    ```

## Running the Example

1.  **Run the data producer:**
    ```bash
    python producer/sensor_simulator.py
    ```
    This script will simulate IoT sensor data and send it to the `sensor_data` Kafka topic.

2.  **Run the data consumer:**
    ```bash
    python consumer/data_analyzer.py
    ```
    This script will consume data from the `sensor_data` Kafka topic and print the received sensor readings.

## Further Development

To build a more robust platform with fault-tolerance and exactly-once delivery, you would need to explore:

* **Kafka Transactions:** For ensuring exactly-once delivery within Kafka.
* **Stream Processing Engines (e.g., Apache Flink, Apache Spark Streaming):** These provide advanced capabilities for fault-tolerant stateful stream processing.
* **Containerization and Orchestration (Kubernetes):** For managing and scaling the platform components.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** To track the health and performance of the system.
